# Genesys Cloud Integration

This directory contains resources for integrating Agent Assist with Genesys Cloud. There are two integration paths available:

1. **Frontend Integration:** For chat-based Agent Assist, using a UI module that can be embedded in the Genesys Cloud agent desktop.
    * [View Frontend Integration README](./frontend/README.md)
2. **Voice Integration:** For voice-based Agent Assist, using Genesys Cloud AudioHook to stream audio to Agent Assist.
    * [View Voice Integration README](./genesyscloud-audiohook/README.md)
