# Salesforce Integration

This directory contains resources for integrating Agent Assist with Salesforce. There are two integration paths available:

1. **Lightning Web Components (LWC):** Integrate Agent Assist UI modules directly into your Salesforce Lightning applications.
    * [View LWC Integration README](./aa-lwc/README.md)
2. **Canvas:** Use Salesforce Canvas to render the Agent Assist UI modules within an iframe in your Salesforce application.
